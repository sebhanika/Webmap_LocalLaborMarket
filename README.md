The initially intended final product covering all of Germany cannot be uploaded to Github because it exceeds 25mb. However I uploaded an extract showing the data for the state of Hesse and Thuringa which can be accessed via https://sebhanika.github.io/hosting_Webmap/. 

The webmap shows employment growth in German municipalities with a population larger than 500 people between 2009 to 2019. The data is sourced from the "Arbeitsmarkt-kommunal" series of the Federal Employment Agency and was part of my Master Thesis at the University of Copenhagen.
